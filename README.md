Picture of working Meeting planner:


**NOTE** This Daily Meeting Planner has been produced by modifying source code. The original source code was cloned from: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme

The HTML in this operational Daily meeting planner is entirely from the cloned source code with the exception of the button at the bottom, the #confirmation paragraph at the top of the main section, and several time slots. The new time slots are effectively copies of those time slots provided in the source code.

CSS is unchanged apart from additional formatting at the bottom for the aforementioned clear button and #confirmation paragraph.

Javascript file is entirely new on the provided Daily Planner.

Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am–5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.

IMPORTANT
Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

Before you start, clone the starter codeLinks to an external site..
